        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>LIFTED GFT Director of Shared Finance and proud mom to my 13-year-old son Graham and 11-year-old daughter Lacey. Born and raised in NH, I received my undergraduate degree from the Univeristy of Rhode Island and I've been with Liberty for almost 20 years. Outside of work you can usually find me taxing my children around or watching them do what they love - they keep me incredibly busy!.</p>

                <h3>Graham</h3>
                <p>Graham was my first project as a parent. We're 13 years into this particular project and very proud of the results. He loves sports and hates my cooking. When last asked what he wanted for dinner, he responded with "dk, as long as its edible".</p>

                <h3>Lacey</h3>
                <p>Lacey is the second project in my parenting initiative, equally proud of these results. She's an animal lover at heart and loves to ride horses. Always quick to call me out when I'm being 'cringe', which is often. </p>

                <p>This is definitely my longest running project and one that I'll continue to iterate on indefinitely. The work isn't easy but it is always worth it.</p>
